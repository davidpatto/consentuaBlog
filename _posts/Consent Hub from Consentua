<Title>Consent Hub from Consentua<Title/>

<H1>The consent hubbub<H1/>
As business becomes more aware of the challenges they face with implementing GDPR the noise in the market place about consent is gaining pace.    This is great for us at Consentua as we provide an awesome consent management service.   
Consent management is creating a new data set. One that is not actually owned by the business but is owned and managed by their customer.  This dataset is the consent receipt. Yet, the business needs to access this consent receipt to check they are allowed to do what they want with regard to a customers personal data.   

<H1>A New Requirement is born<H1/>
What is rapidly discovered is that multiple parties internal and sometimes externally all want to have access to this consent receipt.   Now, the customer tends to have only one or two access points into an organisation (e.g. via an app or direct in store).  However, the business needs many systems to deliver the smile the customer demands.   All these systems use personal data.  They will want to use the consent receipt the customer generates. 

In the era of RESTful services and API’s the concept of sharing a common resource is easy to facilitate.   Which means that the business can confidently state they require a ‘Consent Hub’, knowing the market will respond.    This ‘consent hub’ will act as a common place for consent receipts and manage the access to the consent receipt from requesting parties/systems.  

<H1>Consentua is a Consent Hub<H1/>

I will admit we did not consider Consentua as a consent hub when we created the first version back in 2016.   However, the capability of Consentua as a consent hub has been in place from day one.   

Consentua is a Consent Hub.

This is because the owner of the client consent service (the business requesting a customers consent), can allow any party to access the service to query their consent receipts.  

Consentua, can manage via its admin dashboard the consent requests and consent services the business is using.   Full control and flexibility of the consent service is at the clients control. 

Supporting multi-language, multi-jurisdiction, multi-purposes and different consent scenarios (e.g. employees versus customers consent) all under a single consent management view.
